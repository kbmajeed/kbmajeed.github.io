   <p> I’m a Robotics enthusiast. From Unmanned vehicles to Robotic surgery to Smart Vision Systems, 
    I have passion for every system that can sense, think, and act on its own.
    My experience ranges from Signals and Communications (B.Eng), Systems, Robotics and Control theory (M.Sc), 
    and currently, a Machine learning specialization (2nd M.Sc). I’ve had the opportunity to work with 
    Ultrasonic and EMAT technologies for Oil and Gas In-line inspection. Similarly, I
    have experience in the communcations industry and once helped develop software for a medical facility..</p>
