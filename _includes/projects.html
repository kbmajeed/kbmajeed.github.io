    <p>Reproducing the paper content-aware image resizing presented by Shai-Avidan and Ariel Shamir. 
      Using the seam carving algorithm, three images are subject to: (1) aspect ratio change by seam removal, 
      (b) aspect ratio change by seam insertion, and (c) aspect ratio change by optimal retargeting. 
      Seam carving algorithm performs well in preserving image content during resizing.</p>

    <h3> Exposure Fusion </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Python, OpenCV, Numpy </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exposure fusion is a technique that creates a single image with optimal detail from a set of multi-exposed images. 
        As developed by Tom Mertens et al., the proposed algorithm computes relevant quality measures; Contrast, Saturation, and Well-Exposedness.  
These measures are then combined to create a weight map used to blend each of the multi-exposed images to a single image with best exposure.

    <h3> LMS-based Adaptive Active Disturbance rejection Controller </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Matlab, LMS, ADRC, ESO </li>
    </ul>
    <p>the altitude control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is treated using its altitude dynamics in hover mode. 
    Due to persistent aerodynamic disturbances, the control of a quadrotor unit is cumbersome; especially, the ground wake
     effect which comes into play during landing. In this work, an Adaptive Active disturbance rejection control (AADRC)
      is proposed to compensate for undesirable effects resulting in smoother control. The adaptation of the ADRC controller
       is governed by an LMS algorithm on the extended state observer (ESO).</p>

    <h3> Tracking Endangered Rhinoceros with an Unmanned Drone </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Matlab, Extended Kalman Filter, Backstepping & PD Control </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Backstepping and Proportional-Derivative (PD) methods was used for the control of a quadrotor
    unit and subsequently proposed for autonomous tracking of an endangered species; the ’Northern white rhino’. Extended Kalman
    Filter (EKF) estimation was applied for the localization of the rhino in a virtual wildlife reserve using a single collar sensor on
    the animal while a case of partial sensing was presented for energy saving considerations. The localization system sends the
    rhino’s position trajectories to the quadrotor control system for tracking. This system has the potential to aid rangers, enhance
    surveillance, deter poachers and consequently help preserve endangered wildlife.</p>
